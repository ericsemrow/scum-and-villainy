            "**ACTIONS**\n```attune, command, consort, doctor, hack, helm, rig, scramble, scrap, skulk, study, sway```\nYou make an action roll when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s position. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. If you’re in a **controlled** position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a **desperate** position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in-between, it’s **risky**—usually considered the \"default\" position for most actions.",
            "1. The player states their **goal** for the action.\n2. The player chooses the **action** rating.\n3. The GM sets the **position** for the roll.\n4. The GM sets the **effect** level for the action.\n5. Add **bonus dice**.\n6. The player **rolls the dice** and we judge the result.",
            "```Positions:\n\nControlled: You're set up for success. You’re exploiting a dominant advantage.\n\nRisky: You go head-to-head. You’re acting under duress. You’re taking a chance.\n\nDesperate: You're overreaching. You’re in real trouble. A very dangerous maneuver.```",
            "**BONUS DICE**\nYou can normally get three bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice).\n\nFor one bonus die, you can get assistance from a teammate. They take 1 stress, say how they help you, and give you +1d.\n\nFor another bonus die, you can either push yourself (take 2 stress) or you can accept a Devil’s Bargain (you can’t get dice for both, it’s one or the other). Note though that pushing gives you the option of taking +1 effect. You can push for effect and accept a Devil’s Bargain for an additional die on your roll.\n\nFor a third bonus die, you can spend a gambit. A gambit is a limited resource shared by your whole crew, and earned by taking a few risks.",
            "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/880576764307464272/927667846228631593/unknown.png",

            "```EFFECT\n\nLimited: You achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished?\n\nStandard: You achieve what we would expect as “normal” with the action.\n\nGreat: You achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest?```",
            "ASSESSING FACTORS\n\nTo assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: **potency**, **scale**, and **quality**. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.",
            "**Scale**: This factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk (page 28), or the influence of strange powers.\n**Quality/Tier**: Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by crew quality or faction Tier. Fine items count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier/crew quality.\n\n**Scale**: Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.",
            "`TRADING POSITION FOR EFFECT`\n\n After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they’re going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect."

            "**REDUCED EFFECT**\nThis consequence represents impaired performance. _The PC’s action isn’t as effective as anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up._",
            "**COMPLICATION**\nThis consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action: _the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the crew takes +1 heat from witnesses, you lose status with a faction, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, etc_. The GM might tick a clock for the complication instead.",
            "**LOST OPPORTUNITY**\nThis consequence represents shifting circumstances. _You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slipped away._ To try again, you need a new approach—usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances.",
            "**WORSE POSITION**\nThis consequence represents losing control of the situation—the action carries you into a more dangerous position. _Perhaps you make the leap across to the next balcony, only to end up dangling by your fingertips._ You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position. This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action.",
            "**HARM**\nThis consequence represents a long-lasting debility (or death). When you suffer harm, record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer.",
            "**NON-PHYSICAL HARM**\nHarm doesn’t just have to be broken ribs and knife wounds. “Snubbed” harm can happen at a fancy Governor’s dinner party."

This is the **engagement roll.**\n\nThere are six different plans, each with a missing detail you need to provide (see the list below). To plan a job, simply choose the plan and supply the detail.

Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses orspecial preparations? Take -1d.\n\n- Can any of your friends or contacts provide aid or insight for this operation? Take +1d. Are any enemies or rivals interfering in the operation? Take -1d.\n\n- Are there any other elements that you want to consider? Maybe a lower-Tier target will give you +1d. Maybe a higher-Tier target will give you -1d.
